# This is an example file for making several scans in a go. The different scan types are defined, and the parameters for each scan are specified.
scans:
  - name: Scan Emission           # name of the scan
    type: emission                # type of scan (excitation or emission)
    parameters:                  # parameters for the scan
      integration time: 100ms       # integration time for the scan
      resolution: 0.1          # resolution in nm (also affects light amount)

      excitation wavelength: 750    # excitation wavelength in nm

      scan range:
        start: 200                  # start wavelength in nm
        end: 800                    # end wavelength in nm
        step size: 1                # step size in nm

#Light occluders are used to reduce the light intensity in the system. The value is either in percentage (0-100%) or in a range from 0 to 1.
#Resolution is the parameter that defines how much light is allowed to pass through the monochromator (slit opening after the gratings). This defines the resolution of the scan.
#Resolution is defined in nm, but it can also be defined in percentage (0-100%) or as a fraction (0-1). 
#The higher the resolution, the less light is allowed to pass through the monochromator.
